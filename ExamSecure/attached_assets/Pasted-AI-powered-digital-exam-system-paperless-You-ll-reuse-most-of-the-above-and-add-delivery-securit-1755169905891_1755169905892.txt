AI-powered digital exam system (paperless)

You’ll reuse most of the above and add delivery, security, and roles.

A. Roles

Admin: create exams, manage users.

Instructor: create base questions, set difficulty mix, start/stop exam.

Proctor: monitor sessions, pause/resume specific students.

Student: take exam.

B. What to draw (architecture)

Client (responsive web) ↔️ API ↔️ DB
Plus:

Token service (JWT, 60-min expiry)

Exam Delivery service (locks paper per student)

Integrity features: device + IP capture, copy/print disable hint (front-end), time window, re-entry token, question shuffle

AI modules:

Question generation as above

Summarizer for proctor view (flags suspicious patterns)

Optional: short-answer scorer

Flow
Admin sets exam → Instructor defines difficulty mix (e.g., 40% easy, 40% medium, 20% hard) → On start, for each student: build a paper from base pool with AI variants → Deliver via link → Student submits → Auto-grade → Results → Export.

C. Replit prototype checklist

Add role to users; protect endpoints with Depends(auth)

Endpoints

POST /exam create

POST /exam/{id}/start

POST /exam/{id}/paper (student fetches, returns locked set of variants)

POST /exam/{id}/submit

GET /exam/{id}/results

Multi-device compatibility

Simple responsive HTML (Tailwind or plain CSS); test on phone + laptop

Integrity

Disable right-click + copy via JS (basic, yes it’s bypassable; note this in report)

Time limit on server; server refuses late submissions

Per-student seed; rejoin using same token if device changes

Security basics (state clearly)

Hash passwords (bcrypt)

Store minimal PII

Sign JWT with secret; rotate between exams

D. “Role of AI” section (write this clearly)

Generation: produce paraphrased but equivalent items from instructor-approved bases.

Difficulty control: AI suggests Bloom level and reading level; instructor can override.

Auto-grading: short answers scored by rubric + keyword expansion from AI; code via unit tests.

Proctor aid: AI summaries of anomalies (rapid answer bursts, identical phrasing across students, etc.).
